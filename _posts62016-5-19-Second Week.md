### What did you do this past week?

At the beginning of the week I knocke dout Collatz Sunday and Monday night. It was pretty smooth overall. I made some stupid mistakes that I embaressingly took way too long to debug but I eventually got it. One of the issues I had was using "else if" instead of "elif". Just simple issues of learning python. As I stated last post, I'm still excited learning the simplicity of python

### What's in your way?

Nothing crazy is in my way at the moment other than simple issues. I need to checkout the cache that was built and see how we're suppose to use it. I already use SFTP when using sublime text so I shouldn't have any issue accessing the large database files Downing was talking about in class. 

### What will you do next week?

This week I'm going to jump on Netflix and knock it out real quick, tonight and tomorrow night.  I have a few ideas on how we can get our estimate to be even better based on using the years of the highest rated movies by the users. Maybe mak a linear heat map of the users ratings. We'll see what we can come up with.

### Overall class comments

Class a was a bit confusing this past week for me. Well just certain parts of it. Overall I understood the majoirty of it but some of the different traits between the mutttable containers and the immutable containers started to get confusing near the end of the presentation. I'll look back at the repo and figure out what I was confused on. I will say that comprehensions were blowing my mind when downing was teaching them. So much power in one line of code. Brilliant. Tough to read, but to the point. Python.

### Tip of the week

As I stated earlier I use SFTP when working on the projects. You can edit the files from CS machine on your remote computer in sublime text. I learned how to do this half way through OOP and it has saved me so much time. Just work on the file, save it, and have a terminal window open ssh-ed in and run make test. Its very simple, quick, and easy once setup. The setup sin't that bad either. Here's a great tutorial that I used.
