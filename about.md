Hello my name is Jason Dimitriou and my favorite cereal is Cinnamon Toast Crunch. 

Everytime I meet someone my introductory question is asking them what their favorite cereal is. I don't like being a judgemental person, but I will heavily judge a person on their response to this question. Either you maintained your youth and still eat Apple Jacks on a daily basis or you've grown into a mature healthy lifestyle and you rock the Honey Bunches of Oats. To each his/her own as there isn't a wrong answer to this question as long as you don't say "eh I don't really like cereal". If you say this you're telling me you have lost your youth and there is no spunk to your personality. 

### The story... 

Back to the story, right. I'm a Chicago born computer nerd who found his way in Austin, Texas. Growing up in Chicago gifted me with a great ability to keep it real. I won't bullshit you and I expect you to do the same back. I know when to put my ego aside as one of my favorite things is admitting defeat to learn. I know what I'm good at and I sure as shit know what I'm subpar at. 

Writing is a skill I thought I had when I was younger. I really thought it was a strength of mine, and now I know it has become a weakness. Therefore this blog is going to be a learning tool for me. There will be grammatical errors, spelling erros, and some content that doesn't make any sense. It may be bothering to read, if you care enough shoot me an email and tell me how to better my writing. I'm open to critiques. Hopefully as time progresses the quality of my posts will improve and the errors will become less frequent.

A skill I do have is slapping fingers on this keyboard of mine and producing code that compiles and works most of the time. My expertise right now is iOS development as I'm currently employed full-time as an iOS Developer at [RideScout](http://ridescout.com/). The story of how I got to this point is a whole different story that I'll probably blog about one of these days. Keep your eyes peeled for that one, make sure you have your popcorn ready. 

So yeah, I work full-time and am a part-time student taking six hours (two classes) a semester until I finish my CS degree which should be May 2017. One of the two classes I'm taking right now is CS371p Object-Oriented Programming with the [goat](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=goat) Glenn Downing. I've been looking forward to taking this class ever since I took CS314 with the other goat, Mike Scott. So yes, I'm a nerdy nerd pumped to take a class that is known to be entirely gruelling and time-consuming. I know I'm going to curse myself in a few weeks when I'm up till the sun comes up working on a project, yet I know it'll be worth it.

### Moral of the story tl;dr

I'm a 21 year old kid who was incredibly fortunate to walk himself ass-backwards into a full-time job while attending a great University that is Texas. Object-Oriented Programming, bring the best you got to the table. I'm ready to take you down.
