### What did you do this past week?

This past week I worked on the project a ton. I think I put in over 20 hous last week getting the database up and running. I orginally was doing it wrong but actually implemented it using SQL instead of using SqlAlchemy. But I figured it out and got it up and running. Also implemented the scraper and fixed some unit tests. 

### What's in your way?

Right now nothing is in my way. What was in my way was my lack of knowledge about databases and setting them up. Had some issues connecting the scraper to digital ocean as well. With some help from one of our team members we finally got our data in digital ocean. Now I really think digital ocean is cool and see myself using it in the near future once I'm done with this class and have some free time. 

### What will you do next week?

This week I will be helping the team complete chase 3. A little bit more scraping needs to be done with getting other years of soccer seasons. Right now we have two up there and we need to get more so the next group can visualize the data. 

### Overall class comments

Learning all that SQL in class the other day was pretty crazy. The class definitely dragged a bit but it was very cool seeing how specific you can get with the filter and queries, to a point wehre some of the queries became humorous. I will say I wish we learned SQL before we did all the SQLAlchemy and postgres but either way got to learn multiple database subjects in different ways. 

### Tip of the week

People need to understand real quick that software development doesn't always work. Meaning that getting a new tool up and running is not always easy as one two three. Actually most of the time there is a lot of pain in setting up new tools and getting use to new languages/frameworks/patterns/etc. Don't get down on yourself. Just keep battling the storm and you'll eventually get the system up and running and you'll master it the right way. Learning by failing is my favorite, painful, but no way to conquer a new subject.
