### What did you do this past week?

This past week Brady Miller and I knocked out the Netflix project. At first we were getting and RMSE of 1.0033 which was just not even to pass the requirements. Therefore we went back to the database list and decided to added  acouple more for relating the years of the movies being recieved. Once that was added were got our RMSE down to .96

### What's in your way?

I'm going to answer what will be in my way this week. I'm flying out to San Fransisco Wednesday night until Monday afternoon. So that'll be in my way of jumping in on Phase 1 of this upcoming project.

### What will you do next week?

THis next week I'm going to get up to speed with RESTful APIs, Flask, AngularJS, Digital Ocean and the IMDB project that we will be doing the rest of this class. I just read over the specifications for our project and it seems like a healthy amount of work, so I might be working some late nights when I'm out in SF. Thankfully we will be using Slack to communicate to ease the communciation gap.

### Overall class comments

Everything that we learned on Friday about function keywords, function defaults, function unpacking, function tuple and function dictionary was mind blowing for me. Well it was taught at a healthy pace which is fine but I really saw the power behind it. I've been trying to pick up Swift on the side because I do mobile development in Objective-C and now I'm really starting to see the similarties between python and Swift.

### Tip of the week

Since we will be working with Slack to communicate amongst are teams for these update three projects I recommended integrating Giphy into your messages. It allows you you send gifs over chat.
