### What did you do this past week?

Just like the last couple blogs the entirety of this past week has been working on the project. I personally was still working on the scraping of data. We intially after phase 2 only had a couple eyars of soccer data (which is still a ton of data by the way) but we wanted to a have at least 2010-Present. We had some load issues along with getting throttled by the api we were scraping from. Ultimately we got it figured out and finished the project! It has a been a crazy few weeks knocking this web app out but I learned a ton!

### What's in your way?

This final test is the last parpt of school I have this summer. It is going to be a tough one. I have no idea what it is going to be on because this second half of class wasn't all python, if anythign it was probably half python and half other topics including regex, java hierarchy, sql, and a few others. We will see how this goes Monday.

### What will you do next week?

Monday is the test so I will be studying for that. The projects are done so my main focus is going over all the posts from each class and studying the github seeing what else I can soak up.

### Overall class comments

I'm very happy for this class to be over. That comes off very negative but I don't mean it like that. This class has just been a ton of work and have learned so much that after this class is done Ihave actual ideas and projects I want to start witht he material I have learned form class. So I'm happy for this class to be done so I can take what I learned and actually apply it to real personal projects!

### Tip of the week

Don't turn you weekly blogs in late.
