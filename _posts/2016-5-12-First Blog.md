### What did you do this past week?

This past week I setup the repo for our first project collatz.  Currently I haven’t connected it to Travis and am a bit behind on the project to be brutally honest. I took Object Oriented Programming (OOP) last semester with Downing and the first project was Collatz as well. Therefore I already have all the code written to solve the problem, except that it’s all in C++. So I’m hoping that I can knock it all tomorrow and really start to get to know python. I’ve really enjoyed seeing the simplicity of it in class this past week. I think I’m going to like it even more than I liked C++.

### What's in your way?

There really isn’t anything technical standing in my way when it comes to getting collatz up and running. I will saying my nine to five job is definitely in the way of finding time for this project if I were to consider that “being in my way”. I battled working full time and getting a solid B in OOP last semester so I think I should be able to figure it out this semester as well.

### What will you do next week?

Right away tomorrow (Monday) I will be fully jumping into Collatz and get my hands dirty with learning the greatness that I hope is python. From there I will be getting a head start on project 2. 

### Overall class comments

Fortunately as I mentioned before I already have taken a Downing class when I took OOP last semester. So far the first handful of classes have been pretty identical to what he covered in the beginning of OOP. I will say I keep fist pumping in my head every time Mr. Downing shows us another cool feature of python. 

And yet again to no one’s surprise, throughout each lecture it looks like Mr. Downing has an outstanding grasp over python. Last semester I quickly realized he is a C++ wizard and I already know he is just as good with python. I do wonder which language he prefers more. 

### Tip of the week

If anyone is struggling to pick up any of the concepts in this class whether is python, git, or pretty much anything go to [lynda](https://www.lynda.com/signin/organization) to access a huge library of tutorials. UT now gives free access to these tutorials with our tuition. I highly recommend it.
