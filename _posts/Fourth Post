### What did you do this past week?

This past week I studied for the test and then did well on the test in my opinion. At this point I think I did well, but we'll see when we get the grades back. Downing gives great tests, I always respect tests that are tough yet ask about content was clearly covered in class. The zip question definitly got me, but I believe I did well enough on the rest of the test to make up for that question.

### What's in your way?

This past weekend I was in San Fransisco so I didn't have much time to put towards phase 1 of this web app project. We are doing it on soccer which is great because I grew up playing soccer therefore I can relate to it with ease. Only thing technically blocking me was that trip and now I'm back and ready to grind it out with the group.

### What will you do next week?

Catching up! I hate being that guy in a group project that doesn't pull his weight and I'm self-aware enough to know the rest of the group got a lot of the base work done while I was away. So I'm going to get caught up on that and get Apiary connected to our repo so we can document and test our APIs for furhter phases.

### Overall class comments

Basically had my class comments in the previous question, but again I will say I respected that test. If I were to have a "favorite" part of the test it would be the time. Last semester in OOP the tests were just as good but I always ran out of time. This time around for SWE the test was similar length but double the time. When I had time to go back and check my work I bet I saved 30% of my grade. Very thanksful for that.

### Tip of the week

I'm seeing a bunch of tips by other students giving advice about staying organized and balance your school with your social. All great tips but to help you stay organized I'm a pretty big fan of both Wunderlist and Remember the Milk. Both are great to-do list apps that keep my life in balance.
